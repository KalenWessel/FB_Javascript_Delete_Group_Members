Facebook Delete All Group Members
==================================

With a little javascript magic, this script runs through all the group members on the loaded page
and deletes them one by one. 

It is not the fastest script but it works and allows me to drink beer instead of manually clicking.

Usage
=====
    Browse to your members page http://facebook.com/group/xxxx/members
    Open up Chrome Console
	Paste the JS code into the console and hit enter
